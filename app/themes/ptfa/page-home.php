      We are two young men with a common vision and an inexorable passion for beer, motivated to give Chicago real English ale. Beer is what we offer and the absolute best beer is what we deliver. Present Tense wants to be known for nothing other than remarkable, traditional English ale. We are devoted to producing beer that stands on its own – no need for gimmicky marketing, ridiculous beer names, experimental flavors, and eye-catching branding. No one will question our beer or make excuses for our beer. When you buy our beer, you know exactly what you are getting…real English ale - consistent, honest, straightforward, and genuine.

      On the surface, making exceptional beer and enjoying it with good company is the inspiration behind Present Tense , but running through our veins and seeping out into every beer we make is the insatiable conviction to live in the present and to delight in the moment in which we find ourselves. To lose sight of this is the perpetual obstacle to an abundant life. Our goal is for Present Tense to be a frequent reminder of the things in life that transcend the regrets of the past, the anxiety of the future, the delusion of progress and self-reliance, and the self-gratifying expectations of the now. Freedom from such things is what is meant by living in the Present Tense
